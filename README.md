# 📊 Data Analyst Portfolio

Hi! I’m Parker, and I’m transitioning into a career in data analytics. This portfolio is a snapshot of the skills I’m building and the projects I’m creating using tools like Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, statistics, and data visualization.

Each project is a milestone in my learning journey — with more being added regularly.
