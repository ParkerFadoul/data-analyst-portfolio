# 📊 Data Analyst Portfolio (In Progress)

Hi! I’m Parker, and I’m transitioning into a career in data analytics. This portfolio is a snapshot of the skills I’m building and the projects I’m creating using tools like Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, statistics, and data visualization.

Each project is a milestone in my learning journey — with more being added regularly.

## 🐟 Project: Animal Crossing Fish Analysis

**Tool:** Google Sheets  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Live Link:** [View the dashboard (Google Sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A56wv6nq97LsTDuI9FVRqqgEcHkCvpHmizy9gRkLVCg/edit?gid=1131253864#gid=1131253864)

**Summary:**  
This self-driven data collection and analysis project uses fishing data from *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*. Over the course of July, I manually tracked every fish I caught, categorized by:
- Time of day (9am–4pm vs. 4pm–9am)
- Shadow size
- Fish species

Pier fish were included as ocean fish. Trash was excluded (my island was clean), and I assumed a consistent success rate with catching fish across shadow sizes.

**Key features:**
- 📈 3 interactive dashboards built in Google Sheets
- 🎯 Probability analysis by shadow size and species frequency
- 💰 Average Bells (in-game currency) earned per cast, by time and location

**Quick Insights:**
- 🌊 **Ocean (Night):** Highest Bells per cast — especially for shadow sizes 4 and 6 (with or without fin)
- 🏞 **River:** Spotting size 5 and 6 shadows (vs. misleading size 4) boosts Bell earnings significantly
- 🟣 **Pond:** Low return overall — not ideal unless targeting specific fish

This project demonstrates skills in:
- Manual data collection & cleaning
- Probability and value-based analysis
- Interactive dashboard design
- Clear, concise insight communication

### 📉 Data Quality & Limitations

This project analyzes approximately **3,000 fish** caught in *Animal Crossing: New Horizons* during July (Northern Hemisphere).

- **~1,600 fish** were caught during the **day** (9am–4pm)  
- **~1,400 fish** were caught during the **night** (4pm–9am)  
- Each fish was manually logged with shadow size, time of day, and species

While this dataset reflects one player’s gameplay, the **large sample size** and **consistent data collection** support strong conclusions.

#### Limitations:
- Results reflect one island and one player’s skill
- Only successful catches were recorded
- Trash and bait use were excluded
- A known gameplay quirk (night fish continuing after 9am if the game isn’t reloaded) was used during data collection

Despite these caveats, the data is reliable for uncovering shadow size trends and Bells-per-cast profitability.
