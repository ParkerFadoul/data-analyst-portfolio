# 📊 Data Analyst Portfolio (In Progress)

Hi! I’m Parker, and I’m transitioning into a career in data analytics. This portfolio is a snapshot of the skills I’m building and the projects I’m creating using tools like Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, statistics, and data visualization.

Each project is a milestone in my learning journey — with more being added regularly.

## 🐟 Project: Animal Crossing Fish Analysis

**Tool:** Google Sheets  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Live Link:** [View the dashboard (Google Sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A56wv6nq97LsTDuI9FVRqqgEcHkCvpHmizy9gRkLVCg/edit?gid=1131253864#gid=1131253864)

**Summary:**  
This is a self-driven data collection and analysis project using fishing data from *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*. Over the course of July, I manually tracked every fish I caught, categorized by:
- Time of day (9am–4pm vs. 4pm–9am)
- Shadow size
- Fish species
I marked pier fish as ocean fish and worked them into rotation on islands. I ignored trash because my main island was free of trash. I consider myself decent at fishing, but did not count anything I didn't catch, assuming that my missing rate was similar regarding shadow size spread. 

**Key features:**
- 📈 3 interactive dashboards built in Google Sheets
- 🎯 Probability analysis based on shadow size and frequency
- 💰 Calculated average Bells (currency) earned per cast

**Quick Insights**
- In the Ocean at night, the average bells per cast is highest, especially for size 4 shadow and size 6 shadow, with and without fin.
- In the River, if you can tell the difference between shadow size 4 (bad) and shadow size 5 and 6(good), you make a lot of bells.
- The pond isn't really worth it either time of day unless you need something specific.

This project showcases my abilities in:
- Data collection & cleaning
- Statistical reasoning
- Interactive dashboard design
- Communicating insights with clarity and creativity
