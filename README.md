# 📊 Data Analyst Portfolio (In Progress)

Hi! I’m Parker, and I’m transitioning into a career in data analytics. This portfolio is a snapshot of the skills I’m building and the projects I’m creating using tools like Excel, Google Sheets, SQL, statistics, and data visualization.

Each project is a milestone in my learning journey — with more being added regularly.

## 🐟 Project: Animal Crossing Fish Analysis

**Tool:** Google Sheets  
**Status:** In Progress  
**Live Link:** [View the dashboard (Google Sheets)](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1A56wv6nq97LsTDuI9FVRqqgEcHkCvpHmizy9gRkLVCg/edit?gid=1131253864#gid=1131253864)

**Summary:**  
This self-driven data collection and analysis project uses fishing data from *Animal Crossing: New Horizons*. Over the course of July, I manually tracked every fish I caught, categorized by:
- Time of day (9am–4pm vs. 4pm–9am)
- Shadow size
- Fish species

Pier fish were included as ocean fish. Trash was excluded (my island was clean), and I assumed a consistent success rate with catching fish across shadow sizes.

**Key features:**
- 📈 3 interactive dashboards built in Google Sheets
- 🎯 Probability analysis by shadow size and species frequency
- 💰 Average Bells (in-game currency) earned per cast, by time and location

**Quick Insights:**
- 🌊 **Ocean (Night):** Highest Bells per cast — especially for shadow sizes 4 and 6 (with or without fin)
- 🏞 **River:** Spotting size 5 and 6 shadows (vs. misleading size 4) boosts Bell earnings significantly
- 🟣 **Pond:** Low return overall — not ideal unless targeting specific fish

This project demonstrates skills in:
- Manual data collection & cleaning
- Probability and value-based analysis
- Interactive dashboard design
- Clear, concise insight communication
